So I reckon I want four scripts:

* Take one file from one encode set, plot all of the individual-resolution encodes
  on a shared scale (ie, using sizes and qualities relative to the full-res image)

* Take a source set and several encode sets, and plot the averaged individual-res curves
  on their own scales (ie, using sizes and qualities relative to that resolution),
  along with the averaged multires curves.

  Things we can print:
  * Table per resolution (+ one for multires), in either text or HTML format, of delta rate
    and delta runtime between every pair of encoders

  * Delta rate (and runtime?) between the full-res and multires curves

  This is the closest to the current plot script

* Take a source set and a set of curves (name and a list of encode sets), and plot
  size vs. runtime graphs per resolution (+ one for multires). For each curve, the
  list of selected encode sets are coloured the same and joined up, and get one legend entry.
